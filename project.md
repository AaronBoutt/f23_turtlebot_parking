## CS-460 Project
Members: Aaron Bouttapanith, Joshua Jacobs

CS-460-001 Group Project

Instructor: Monica Anderson Herzog

## Summary of Work and Relevant Literature
This project is the mid-semester project for Intro to Autonomous Robotics in Fall 2023.
### Approach
#### Goal

  The goal is to program a robot to park between a designated parking space.
  
  At the very least the goal is to be able to run park a robot in simulation.
  
  The best outcome is an implementation into an actual turtlebot.
#### Implementation

  The project will be implemented in ros2.
  
  We will be using the turtlebot model BURGER.
  
  The turtlebot will be equiped with a LIDAR and odometry.
  
  Webots will be the choice the implementation
  
  * I have taken the previous homeworks with the Lab world and implemented it into this project
    
  Detection using LIDAR will be the main resource.

  * LIDAR will detect an object and then the robot will begin to park.
    
  * Reflectivity will be used to detect the parking space
